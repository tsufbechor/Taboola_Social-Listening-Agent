    "text": "[DD] Taboola (TBLA) - FCF-positive ad-tech at single-digit multiple, buybacks ramping **TL;DR**  \nTaboola just printed a solid Q2-25: revenue up 9 % YoY to $465 M, ex-TAC gross margin 36.9 %, Adjusted EBITDA $45 M (+21 % YoY) and free cash flow $34 M. Management turned around and 1) repurchased $100 M of stock (\\~5 % of the float) and 2) paid down $38 M of debt, yet the company still holds a small net-cash position and sits at &lt;0.5× gross leverage. At \\~8× forward FCF.\n\n# Numbers\n\n|Metric|Q2-24|Q2-25|YoY Δ|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$428 M|**$465 M**|**+8.7 %**|\n|ex-TAC GP|$149 M|**$172 M**|\\+15 %|\n|Adj. EBITDA|$37 M|**$45 M**|\\+21 %|\n|FCF|$28 M|**$34 M**|\\+24 %|\n\n* **Operating leverage showing** – TAC rate fell 115 bp, opex only +11 %, margins expanded.\n* **Cash is real** – 75 % of EBITDA dropped to cash even after $13 M cap-ex.\n* **Capital return** – Treasury-share line jumped $101 M and share count is down \\~12 M QoQ.\n* **Balance sheet healthy** – Net cash $27 M, current ratio 1.08×, no covenant pressure.\n\n# Catalysts\n\n1. **Yahoo partnership ramp** – Commercial agreement amortizes at $4 M/quarter. Each dollar of incremental RPM lifts margin disproportionately.\n2. **Buyback authorization** – $200 M still open (roughly 15 % of mkt-cap) and FCF can fund it within 18 months.\n3. **GAAP turn** – Intangible amortization rolls off by 2027. GAAP earnings will begin to mirror non-GAAP next year.\n4. **Ad-spend rebound** – Any macro tailwind to digital ad budgets gives TBLA instant topline leverage.\n\n# Risks\n\n* High publisher concentration (Yahoo &gt;20 % of rev) – a renegotiation would sting.\n* Macro ad-spend slowdown could stall the improving TAC trend.\n* Share-based comp still $16 M/qtr, dilutive if buybacks pause.\n* Competitive pressure from native ad rivals and social platforms.\n\n# Valuation Snap\n\n* Market cap **$1.2 B** (at $4.40)\n* LTM FCF **$126 M** ⇒ **8.0× FCF**\n* Adj. EBITDA **$160 M** ⇒ **7.5× EV/EBITDA**\n\nPeers like Criteo trade 10-12× while carrying net debt and lower buyback yields.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\nTaboola is quietly converting revenue growth into cash, buying back stock below intrinsic value and deleveraging at the same time. At a single-digit FCF multiple and with multiple catalysts ahead, risk-reward skews positive for small-cap hunters. Do your own DD, size your positions responsibly and mind the macro.\n\n*I am long TBLA. This post is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.*",

We’ll benchmark downstream metrics (e.g., demo requests, purchase intent) alongside Meta to see which channel truly delivers more qualified leads.\n\nOnce we have those email-quality metrics, we’ll know if the $5+ CPA on native is justified by stronger downstream engagement—or if we need to tighten our audience or creative to push it closer to Meta benchmarks.

If you stick to tight tests, ruthlessly cut the underperformers, and double down on winners, you’ll start seeing CPAs you’re happy with—even below Meta benchmarks. Good luck!",

It’s slightly under 1%, but because our CPC was only $0.20, our CPA still landed around $5.\n\n2. **Advertorial vs. Direct**\n\n\\- I totally agree advertorial funnels shine for complex or high-ticket offers. In this test, our goal was a **simple email opt-in**, so we went direct-to-form. Next round, we’re testing a 300-word presell advertorial -&gt; lead magnet page to see if CTR/quality upticks.\n\n3. **Budget &amp; Data Velocity**\n\n\\- The $10k rule is legit if you need hyper-granular placement data. That said, with **focused A/B tests** and **daily CTAs** (pause losers at CTR &lt; 0.3%), you can get solid learnings in **$1–2k**. The key is iterating fast—kill underperformers within 24–48 hours—then scale your winners.\n\nBottom line: aim for 1%+ CTR, but don’t let a slightly lower CTR scare you off if your CPC/CPA stays profitable. Test both direct and advertorial funnels, start lean, iterate fast, and then pour on the budget once you’ve proven your winners. Good luck!",

So if we hit that conversion threshold, $5 per lead is definitely sustainable—anything above that starts to squeeze our margins pretty tight.\n\nMy last post was drafted by me, but I did run it through ChatGPT purely as an editing tool—to tighten up the language and make sure I didn’t miss any key points. All of the suggestions and data points are based on our real-world campaign performance, not AI “hallucinations.”\n\nYou’ve given some solid pointers on targeting and ad copy tone, and I really appreciate that.

If you’re dropshipping and considering native traffic, don’t treat it like TikTok or Meta. Different rules apply — and mistakes get expensive fast.\n\n**Some takeaways:**  \n• Split campaigns by device *and* by country  \n• Don’t launch with &lt; 10× your CPA — €400/day isn’t overkill  \n• Use editorials/listicles, not direct-to-product  \n• Watch for message mismatch: high CTR but no PDP views = fail  \n• MaxConversions bidding from day one — not manual CPCs  \n• Only 6 ad variants per campaign. Trust the algo, not your gut.\n\nI broke down all 10 lessons here (no fluff):  \n  \n👉 [https://www.nativeads.blog/post/taboola-ads-tips-ecommerce-campaigns](https://www.nativeads.blog/post/taboola-ads-tips-ecommerce-campaigns)  \n  \n**Hope it helps anyone testing native as a new traffic source.

    "text": "advice on working with an ad management company to replace Taboola Hi, I am running ad operations for a small publisher with several domains that are currently running a combination of Adsense and Taboola ads. Taboola ads are by far our biggest source of ad revenue, and we have a direct relationship with Taboola, but because of our small size it's not really a great fit working with them directly. We only generate a few hundred dollars a day of ad revenue, so we're too small to be very interesting to them.  \n  \nI'd like to find an ad management company that can be the intermediary between us and Taboola, so we don't have to deal with maintaining the relationship directly anymore (it's just quite a hassle for us, as their expectations around our growth are not really achievable).\n\nCould someone help me get the lay of the land on how to get Taboola ads without working with Taboola directly? I see tons of folks out there who seem to be working with intermediaries, but I don't know how to distinguish one from another. We're not really looking for a full yield management solution (Taboola ads seem to be working quite well and we don't want to change our site a ton).\n\n\n\nImportant: We also use Taboola's feature of organic cross-posting quite heavily in our sites, so any ad management company we work with would have to be able to support that placement type.\n\n  \nThank you so much!",

Nope.**\n\n**Canva's ADDITIONAL AFFINITY TERMS stipulate that:**\n\n### Your \"Perpetual License\" Is Now Linked to a Canva Account\n&gt; \"Your right to use Affinity is linked to your Canva account. Access to the Affinity Software and certain paid features requires an active Canva account and depends on your subscription type.\"\n&gt;\n&gt; \"Access may require online verification through an entitlement check.\"\n\n**What this means:** You can't use the software you bought without a Canva account and online verification. The \"perpetual license\" people paid for is now conditional on maintaining a Canva account and being online.\n\n*Old Affinity: Desktop software with offline activation. No account required after initial activation.*\n\n### Canva Can Revoke Your Access At Any Time Without Notice or Refund\n&gt; \"Canva (or its affiliates or licensors) may suspend, remove, modify or disable (or impose limits on) access to the currently available Affinity Software and/or any Affinity-Licensed Content at any time without notice and without liability to you.\"\n\n**What this means:** They can take away the software you paid for, whenever they want, for any reason, without warning, and they owe you nothing.\n\n*Old Affinity: Perpetual license meant you owned that version forever.*\n\n### No Guarantee the Software Will Keep Working\n&gt; \"Neither Canva, nor its affiliates or licensors make any representations or warranties that:\n&gt;\n&gt; b) The Affinity Software will continue to be made available or maintained or that any defects will be corrected\"\n\n**What this means:** They don't have to maintain the software, fix bugs, or even keep it available. You paid for it, but they have no obligation to make it work.\n\n*Old Affinity: Regular updates and bug fixes were provided for perpetual licenses.*\n\n### CANVA CAN ENTER YOUR BUSINESS TO AUDIT YOU\n&gt; \"Canva or its authorized agent will be entitled to enter onto your premises with reasonable notice to audit your use of the Affinity Software.\"\n\n**What this means:** If you're using Affinity in a business, Canva can send people to physically come to your workplace and inspect your computers.\n\n*Old Affinity: No audit rights mentioned in privacy policy.*\n\n### You're Responsible If It Doesn't Work\n&gt; \"It is your responsibility to ensure the Affinity Software performs the purpose for which it is required and will function properly in the environment in which it is to be used. Its use is at your sole risk and you are responsible for any cost of repair, corrections or servicing.\"\n\n**What this means:** Even though you paid for professional software, if it doesn't work for your needs, that's your problem and your expense to fix.\n\n*Old Affinity: Professional software with support and regular bug fixes.*\n\n### New Terms Can Be Imposed at Any Time\n&gt; \"Where you are supplied with any updates, upgrades or new versions of the Affinity Software, these Affinity Terms and the Agreement will apply to the use of such updates, upgrades or new versions unless new terms accompany such updates, upgrades or new versions, in which case the new terms will apply to all use of the updated, upgraded or new version of the Affinity Software.\"\n\n**What this means:** Every update can come with new terms that you must accept or lose access to the software.\n\n*Old Affinity: Terms were stable; updates didn't change your license agreement.*\n\n---\n\nAffinity promised a professional software that is offline, that doesn't spy on us or sells our data. By becoming part of Canva and the use of their new Affinity Studio being locked behind a mandatory Canva account they force these new rules onto you.\n\nThat's why it's free.\n\nIt's to force you to make a Canva account and by doing so agree to their new rules. They could just transfer your Affinity account but they'd still be bound by the agreements you made with Affinity. If they sent you an email asking you to agree to the new Privacy Policy, people would notice and ignore it or outright refuse.\n\nIf you want Affinity for free then say that. It's fine to want to save money especially in this day and age but please stop acting like this is some generous tiny company that has your best interests in mind and just wants to help.\n\nCanva is a billion-dollar private company. They are actively trying to increase their valuation before eventually going public. Once the profits level again, they are going to introduce more subscription-only features.\n\nCapCut has done the same thing. Initially it was an amazing free app. Then it introduced a subscription that was pretty affordable and wasn't really needed. Now it's got a subscription model that is so predatory it puts Adobe to shame and if you don't buy it the number of ads is worse than the worst 'free' games on the App Store. You're bombarded by them constantly. Sure it's still free but is it really.\n\nFeel free to also read the policies. It was so much fun and definitely not just something I did for fun.",

ALL companies (e.g. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Adobe, and Canva) love to have information on you to datamine. This passive acceptance of their default terms benefits them and their partners. \nSo if you want to understand what is behind “Free” you need to review what you are allowing them to do with your information unless you take active steps to limit that information. \nTo the OP, WandererMisha: Thank you for the research and exposure of what many in social media do not pay attention to.

    "text": "Your list is much, much, much shorter if you remove all the alarmism, incomplete context, etc.\n\nFor instance, Team related stuff. Apparently, you've never had a situation where an employee quits and all work they did is forever lost, or a company hires you to do their software/website and you have to track down the original dev and hope they can give you access to the original source material, logins, or someone wanting a change to their existing collateral and you needing to track down the original PSDs, EPS, or other files. Everything related to teams and employer make clear, common sense. Even just you listing “Team leader can see your email.” How do you expect someone to add you to an online service without knowing your email or some way to add you specifically? Telepathy?\n\n&gt;“We may share your information, including personal data, with third-party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the Websites or our products and services (including for billing and credit card payment processing, maintenance, sales, marketing, administration, customer support, data enrichment, and database management services, or outside professional advisors) or co-sponsors and presenters of webinars and events that you attend or co-branded content partners when you download or request certain marketing of such content.”\n\nNo shit, right? They are going to use any number of payment processors like EBANX or Pix for those in Latin America, and so on. And your info has to be shared. How do you process a card if there is no card for the processor to process? How do you verify their identity? Detect fraud?\n\nHow do they do tech support, customer service? Do they use notepads? Or do they use JIRA or other platforms that are customer-facing, and what do they use internally for their CRM, ERP, and other software? Just like every business including your local small coffee shop with their POS system? Do they not store data in a database and just write their millions of customers on whiteboards? Or do they use AWS, and other services for various things they require like Firebase, or Big Query or any number of platforms?\n\nAnd for marketing, they are using analytics software, programmatic ad platforms, and other things most companies use. Including mom and pop stores. Serif did the same thing to which you either don't understand or left out. (Example: \\_ga\\_30948M69Q6)\n\nThe very fact that you included so much related to Public Exposure (and related categories) is odd to me. You can choose for something to be PUBLIC on their platform or PRIVATE. Obviously public means public. Are you really shocked that public means public? Did you think public meant invisible? Edit: And see below that Canva explicitly says in their policy that they don't recommend this for most cases, and it is not a default setting.\n\nAll the tracking stuff, like what tools you use on their online designer, etc., are all clearly aimed at improving their systems, designer, marketing, etc., so that you have a better experience, and they have a better product, and of course, they convert more people that visit. But you are also being dishonest. You say, “Monitor your cursor movements in real-time.” But you don't give any indication that this is specifically about the cursor of people viewing a design and commenting on it (So you can see what they are referencing) when it is set to anyone with the link. And that Canva explicitly says, “We do not recommend this option (Anyone with link) for information you wish to keep confidential.” and, “Our designs are private by default. When sharing and interacting with designs, make sure the privacy settings are appropriate. For designs with personal or confidential information, we don’t recommend ‘anyone with the link’ setting.”\n\nAnd on and on. And let me be clear: Most everything you posted has to do with their online service, not Affinity desktop app, which has its own Terms. It is clear that they are clearly talking about their website, their online designer, and the traditional Canva items in almost everything you list. Not the software. And even in those cases, there is nothing surprising, unexpected, and so forth.",

You would create said account to use the Canva Platform  where those things matter in the context of said platform at an enterprise level. So any and all conditions reliant on enterprise or business level do not apply to Affinity desktop app for most users.\n\nAgain you don’t understand the language. The entire Terms applies to everything under Canva umbrella. You don’t get to pick and choose which parts apply and when, they do. Yes there are different parts that apply to Enterprise accounts vs Individuals, as well as public s private content, however that doesn’t mean the Terms don’t cover everything with their corporate umbrella. \n\nAFAIK Serif didn’t have that concept of Enterprise - so that is new with Canva.  However if you’re at a company that has an existing enterprise agreement - regardless of what the previous terms were - that enterprise agreement most likely now extends to the use of the Affinity product on the desktop with V3, regardless of how the account used to activate was created (individual account using corporate email vs enterprise account using same corporate email). \n\n&gt; None of the PUBLIC things have anything to do with Affinity since you can't save a document as Public inside the Affinity App.  \n\n“Yet” is the key. You’re applying logic as the product exists right now. Nobody is arguing that the product currently has features that trigger this part of the Terms. However any subsequent release of the product can shift to store resources on their cloud infrastructure (with or  without your knowledge - the terms for v3 allow this). I can see Canva adding features to Affinity that mirror that of Adobe’s online portfolio. As soon as that happens that snippet becomes relevant.  They aren’t rewriting their Terms each product release - that’s asinine. \n\n&gt; And since Canva explicitly (on the Canva Platform) sets everything to private at default, the public related sections have nothing to do with Affinity. And that is a large chunk of the OP's message (alongside enterprise and business aspects.)\n\nThere is mixed reporting on this. Many have found their accounts defaulted to public, others private. I suspect this may vary by how laws are applied globally.  It could be existing agreements for enterprises enforced by email domain. Canva is going to probably make things public by default where they legally can and force opt-out vs opt-in - whichever setting benefits them most. I’m not going to argue on this - it doesn’t really matter, as it doesn’t change the Terms. It’s up to the individual to figure out what their settings are and how the Terms apply to them with those settings.  \n\nIn general companies don’t write multiple terms typically unless they are engaging with large corporations.  eg Canva might be willing to write special terms for their products for a company like Deloitte, who might be buying thousands of subscriptions. Canva crafted terms that are generally applicable across their products and services as features are modified and introduced over time. They aren’t going to rewrite their Terms each time a new feature is released when it’s already covered in the existing Terms. \n\nThis is what you don’t understand apparently. What you agree to now is what you’re agreeing into the future unless they change the terms. Today the product might not have the capability for all features of the Terms to apply; one or two software updates a year from now can change all that - and because you already agreed - those parts of the Terms that didn’t apply now do.",

    "text": "The best alternatives to Taboola and Outbrain **Taboola and Outbrain** are two of the most well-known **native advertising networks**, helping publishers monetize their websites by displaying sponsored content recommendations. These platforms use AI-driven algorithms to place relevant ads within articles or at the end of posts, blending seamlessly with the site's content. They are widely used by major media outlets and offer high-quality ads that can generate substantial revenue. However, one of the biggest challenges for smaller publishers is meeting their **strict eligibility requirements**.\n\n**Taboola requires websites to have at least 500,000 monthly page views**, a strong history of publishing high-quality content, and compliance with strict content guidelines. Similarly, **Outbrain** has a minimum traffic requirement of around 100,000 monthly page views and **only works with sites that have consistent, high-quality editorial content**. These high entry barriers make it difficult for smaller publishers to get approved, forcing them to look for alternative networks.\n\nFor publishers struggling with Taboola’s and Outbrain’s high requirements, **MGID and AdsKeeper** represent viable alternatives that offer strong monetization potential while maintaining the seamless, native ad experience that enhances user engagement.\n\n# [MGID Review](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2022/11/mgid-native-advertising-network-review.html)\n\nMGID, founded in 2008, is one of the leading native advertising platforms that works with a wide range of publishers, including those with lower traffic levels than Taboola or Outbrain. It provides AI-driven content recommendations and a flexible approval process, making it more accessible. MGID offers competitive revenue shares, advanced targeting options, and a global advertiser base, ensuring that publishers receive relevant and high-performing ads.\n\nLink: [**Sign up in MGID**](https://dashboard.mgid.com/?r=d960f4589587137b98c4e37dd59a2f5b)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvl41fmy5aqe1.png?width=279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c27abc859a3d19cff0a7e7ed11b6c3aa765c10\n\n**--------------------------------**\n\n# [AdsKeeper Review](https://www.moneyonline.wiki/2023/06/adskeeper-review-guide-payments.html)\n\nAdsKeeper, on the other hand, is another strong contender in the native advertising space. It offers an easy approval process, allowing smaller and medium-sized publishers to join without strict traffic requirements. AdsKeeper focuses on delivering engaging, user-friendly native ads that integrate seamlessly into a website’s content, increasing user engagement and earnings.

In their article [posted from 2021](https://blog.taboola.com/taboola-tech-is-built-for-a-cookieless-world/) Taboola claims they're ready for a post-3rd party cookie environment, but I'm having trouble fully believing that. What do others think?\n\nIt seems to me the extent to which they are vulnerable to a loss of 3rd party cookies depends on how reliant their big advertisers are on 3rd party cookies informing traffic buying decisions on the Taboola platform. \n\nAlso, Taboola continues to site a $100B market of open-web traffic that's yet to be absorbed into the Google publishing space, hinting that this is their target market.

    "text": "As the CEO of a direct Taboola competitor, I am probably qualified to attempt to answer this question....\n\nTLDR: \n\n* I agree with u/SouthwestBLT comment.  \"The short answer is when any publisher or dsp says they are ready for third party deprecation is they have an offering that does not need cookies to function.\"\n* they will likely see some negative impact from the 3PC deprecation, but not enough to slow them down and not nearly as much as what other platforms in the \"programmatic\" ecosystem will see\n* Publishers who are reliant on programmatic revenue will likely double down on their reliance (and likely increase the ad footprint) on RevContent, Taboola, Outbrain, etc. as an earnings channel while the shit-storm following 3PC deprecation plays out.\n\nTo all of the people that hate on the content rec business model in this sub....I understand the criticism and think it's for the most part warranted. It doesn't take a genius to look at these ads and make jokes, but the reality is that the situation with digital publishing is somewhat dire and becoming more dire by the day/quarter/year.\n\nBad news to the content rec critics: 3PC deprecation is going to make the content rec medium stronger and bigger (in terms of both revenue and increasing ad real estate). \n\nIf you're in this channel buying for or on behalf of a premium brand or agency, I think the medium is a a sub-optimal use of your time/resources in its current iteration, but the reality is that money talks and money typically wins. There are few industries where this is more pertinent than in today's digital publishing ecosystem. For every incremental increase in degree of shittyness you see in your experience trying to consume content on internet websites, there is a proportional increase in how difficult it is for publishers to make money because of trillion dollar purveyors of information and innovation perpetually moving goalposts to better service the needs of their businesses. \n\nContent rec exists because it (a) it helps publishers make (a lot of) money, pay staff, try new things, diversify content, etc. (b) keeps content free (for the most part) to users engaging with content outside of walled gardens. Journalism and freedom of information (ideally without algorithmic influence) does matter. However ugly the execution may be (for now), it's an important cause to keep funding in any way that's realistically possible or sustainable. \n\n***Non-TLDR answer to my opinion of Taboola's exposure to 3PC deprecation:*** \n\nTaboola is a publicly traded company and you can get some insight into these questions from their [investor presentations](https://investors.taboola.com/) and filings\n\n**Where it probably won't have a meaningful negative impact:**\n\n* Taboola has minimal exposure to programmatic demand. This means that most of their revenue comes from advertisers buying traffic directly through the Taboola platform rather than through an SSP connection. They frequently mention and even lead with this information on earnings calls.\n* Taboola has code on page across thousands of publishers. This is a big deal. [Slide 27](https://investors.taboola.com/static-files/5da3542d-8ece-4173-b1f9-db522947b95f) from their most recent investor presentation lays this out in a concise manner\n\n**Where it probably will matter:**\n\n* CONTENT ARB - Taboola has a lot of advertisers that buy clicks from the widgets and run them into galleries and sites (maybe MFA, maybe not). These advertisers almost entirely depend on 3PC to make margin against the CPC they pay for a click within Taboola\n* VIDEO - Taboola [acquired a video company](https://www.taboola.com/press-release/taboola-enters-agreement-acquire-convertmedia-hyper-growth-outstream-company-50m-run#:~:text=Daily%20%7C%20Taboola.com-,Taboola%20Enters%20Agreement%20to%20Acquire%20ConvertMedia%2C%20a%20Hyper%2DGrowth%20Outstream,a%20Billion%20Video%20Streams%20Daily) years ago and to this day makes 9 figures of annual revenue injecting video onto publisher sites. These are high yield/high revenue integrations that are heavily reliant on the 3PC. This area will see headwinds from the deprecation of the 3PC. \n* PREBID: Taboola is a large, public company.  They're going to do +$2bn revenue in 2024. They NEED to capture more market share from the open web ecosystem to survive and grow their EV, which means generating revenue from business line items that aren't the typical below article, code on page real estate we are all used to seeing. One of presumably many ways they're currently doing this is by investing resources into the prebid/banner ecosystem. \n   * In this environment, TBLA bids on a CPM, and sells the inventory on a CPC to their advertisers (reverse price arbitrage). This is a relatively new business for them (&lt;5 years) and it means they have to be DIALED IN on CTR prediction for that banner placement, otherwise: (a) they see less margin (or actually lose money) (b) they lose the auction to a more well established players in that ecosystem. \n      * There is presumably a significant reliance on 3PC to determine which users to bid on SO if the 3PC is gone, they will see a revenue decline from this product \n\n**Here is an excerpt from a Shareholder letter released with a 2023 earnings call:**\n\n* We estimate that the 8,000+ publishers in our core business generate display revenues of \\~$20-25B a year. We think that we can access our publishers’ display inventory with our Header Bidding solution, and win about 5-10% of the auctions given our advantage in AI, first party data and other data. This will make us even more valuable partners for our publishers, increasing our payments to them as well as our share of wallet, while providing our advertisers with even more scale. Especially as cookies on Chrome are about to be deprecated, based on our experience with Apple ITP, we anticipate this to be a source of strength for our bidder given our access to first party data. We have 3 areas where we bid: (1) Microsoft/MSN - this launched in April of last year; (2) publisher partners using our core solutions where we have first party advantage; and (3) publishers not currently  \nusing our core solutions where we have unique demand but not first party advantage. We believe that as Yahoo launches, we’ll be able to also partner with Yahoo on bidding as well (....) Beyond Microsoft, we are excited to continue expanding our bidding technology across the open web to bring Taboola’s demand to our publisher partners at scale. In Q2, we doubled down on our efforts and are now live on over 100 sites across our global network of publisher partners. As we continue to scale, we are laser focused on fine tuning our technology and algorithms, leveraging our ongoing investment in R&amp;D and Operations of our bidder platform.\n\nThese are educated correlations I've personally made through various documents, calls and videos I've engaged with over the years, and are ultimately my opinion, so go easy on me with the inevitable rage replies.",

    "text": "Is Taboola and Outbrain on the out given the focus on MFA I've noticed a lot of discussion about Made for Advertising (MFA) sites, particularly regarding the prominent role of platforms like Taboola and Outbrain in distributing clickbait content. It appears that their business models heavily rely on arbitrage sites. With SSPs and DSPs increasingly blocking these sites, I'm curious about who will continue to use these advertising platforms.\n\nAdditionally, the business of buying clicks for $0.05 and trying to profit has become increasingly challenging. Margins were already thin, and now they're practically non-existent.\n\nA recent critical article about Forbes has highlighted a significant issue: a well-known brand doesn't necessarily equate to quality. This revelation suggests that advertisers and brands need to be more discerning about their partnerships.\n\nWhile Taboola might have a longer trajectory due to its partnership with Yahoo, I'm puzzled by this decision and question its long-term viability. In my opinion, the future of both companies hinges on their ability to reconcile quality content with click generation.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and insights on this topic. How do you see the future of such advertising platforms evolving",

Always felt weird to have those units on your site when they don't match your content and sometimes are really questionable. \n\nOne time one of the brands Revcontent had some questionable content. They had a younger lady showing her cleavage off. At the time I was actually in negotiation with an ad agency about having them represent me. The lady at the ad agency just happened to run into that ad and screenshots and sent it back to me. She was none Too impressed with it and to be honest they did not end up wanting to do a deal with me because of it. I had little control over what was ran on my site even though I complained afterwards but it was too late because the deal was dead. \n\nYou have to wonder how those units work with Google 's helpful content update. I would have to think that those units actually if they were indexable would be a very low scoring unit to have. A lot of the content can sometimes be very clickbaity at the same time. Just for those two reasons alone, I am very skeptical. I understand that they have to promote what they feel is going to work. However, you should be able to pick your own categories of content to show on those ad units. For example, if you had a car site, it would be appropriate to have car content on it. That would ensure higher click-through rates and and the more contextual it is, the more beneficial it is to the side owner and the readers. Many times, however, they don't do a great job on it to end. They become a exit for readers because of its content and when readers run out of decent stories, they're out of there. \n\nIn my limited run with them and this was a very long time ago and I doubt it has changed much but they did not pay great and the load times of them really slowed my pages down. So it was a negative experience just from that factor. \n\nHowever, I understand that publishers nowadays because of programmatic and the low cpms they are paid are looking at different types of advertising on their site for diversification. The industry is bottoming out with programmatic so badly that these units are ones that a lot of sites don't want to use but end up having to use because they're forced to get their ad revenue up. \n\nI mean everything is a choice but with low cpms display advertising has really bottomed out. It's no wonder people have a bad user experience because site owners have to has to litter their site with these type of ads and videos and tons of display advertising to have a somewhat acceptable RPM.",

    "text": "Honest Thoughts on Native Ads Support like Taboola I’ve been working in paid media for years, mostly with Native Ads, and I wanted to share something I’ve noticed about support on certain platforms. Compared to other traffic sources I’ve used (like search or social), the level of support here is genuinely a breath of fresh air.\n\n# What Makes It Different\n\nHere’s what stands out for me:\n\n* **Weekly Calls Are a Thing:** Regular calls with an account manager to discuss campaigns, strategies, or issues. No endless back-and-forth emails, just direct problem-solving.\n* **Fast and Helpful Email Support:** Their email responses are quick and usually very specific. I rarely feel like I’m talking to a bot or getting generic advice.\n* **Communication via Slack in Some Regions:** In some markets, they even offer Slack or similar tools for communication, which makes everything faster and more collaborative.\n* **No Random Account Suspensions:** Unlike what I’ve experienced elsewhere, there’s no anxiety about accounts suddenly disappearing. If something’s flagged, they’re transparent about the reasons and give clear guidance to fix it.\n\n# Compared to Other Platforms\n\nWith other channels, I’ve often felt like getting decent support was tied to how much you’re spending – and even then, it’s hit or miss. Here, I’ve found the support to be way more consistent, regardless of budget size.\n\n# A Quick Disclaimer\n\nI want to be fully transparent: I work at Taboola, so I know this might come across as biased. But this post is based on my general experience in paid media over the years. I’ve worked with plenty of platforms, and the points above genuinely reflect why I think this kind of support is worth mentioning.\n\nCurious if anyone else has noticed similar differences in support across channels? Let’s hear your thoughts.",

That means for the 1,000 ad impressions, you got 10 clicks (1% of 1,000). You paid $3 to get 10 clicks to your site. That means you need to pay $300 to get 1,000 clicks to your site. A thousand clicks to your site from the ads you run means you have 1,000 pageviews, enough to sell one CPM of ads yourself so someone that wants to advertise on your site. \n\nHow much do you think your site can charge for those ads? Let’s say $5 CPMs. That means if you ran one ad on the page, the 1,000 pageviews you just got will get you $5 of ad revenue. You paid $300 to get 1,000 pageviews, to earn $5 in ad revenue.

    "text": "I understand it's been 10 months now, but I wanted to dispel a bunch of the bullshit and dogma around the arbitrage business model.\n\nFirst and foremost, you can't equate them to the typical scammy \"traffic arbitrage\" bullshit that used to be rampant 10 years ago. It still is, but no reputable network (SSP etc) will work with you. Sure, you can get into some shady redirect/popunder networks, but they pay dogshit and might even refuse to pay out.\n\nNow, to answer /u/floodlight137 \\- you don't need sub-penny traffic. You wouldn't get a decent visitor with subpenny traffic that you could monetize. I buy traffic between $0.02-0.04 (2 to 4 cents, US). And I have a minimum ROI of 130%. If I spend $1000, I **profit** $300 (EBITDA, ofc).\n\nAs /u/Brogrammatic pointed out, you typically see RPMs in the $1-2 range. And that is sufficient for achieving profitability. I display 5 ads per \"page\" on infinite scroll. On average, a visitor scrolls through 10 pages (actually more, but I want to simplify the math). So 50 ad impressions. At a $1 RPM, I will make ($1/1000)\\*50 or $0.05. If I manage to buy traffic at $0.03 (3 cents, US), I make $0.02 profit. So for $1000, I make $666.66... Let's say click loss is at 40% (people that click the ad but bounce or whatever and never see any ads). My profit will be \\~$400.\n\n/u/Slind14 that's not true at all. I currently buy hundreds of thousands of clicks every day in the cpc range mentioned above. On Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and native.\n\n/u/AugustineFou in your original post, you mentioned 1% CTR. If you have 1% CTR, you can NEVER be successful with this form of arbitrage. I know people that sell snake oil on the internet that have much better CTR with ads that they hand drew on a paper napkin and took a photo of with their Nokia 7650. My CTR is **always** in the 15-20% range. If it isn't, I kill the ad.\n\nAlso, a lot of people in this thread talk about CPC-based earnings. That isn't the case. Real arbitrage plays involve serious adops setups and are based on impressions and not clicks. Also, there's header-bidding.",

Some will have a Next button which will load a 2nd page and onwards, each page will be considered another impression.\n\nBut something even more clever I've noticed some sites do is a seemingly endless scroll of listicles.\n\nIf you actually pay attention to the URL, you'll notice that for every scroll you do to get to the next list item, the URL changes without affecting the frontend experience for the visitor.\n\nThe visitor feels like they're on the same page but they're actually on page 10 or whatever on the back end. Again more impressions.\n\nSo on average 1 visitor is probably worth 15 impressions, maybe more for the scroll type. If they’re able to get $0.10 CPC or they manage to get even higher pages per visitor then the math would work. \n\nBut let me know what you think",

I mean that would be better if you have experience with both and you share your thoughts about these.\nBasically, just reading and after doing some research I want to run Ads for Brand Awareness for my company. I proposed idea of Taboola Ads that it's cheaper for brand awareness and CPC is lower than Google Display Ads. Now, I have to defend this idea in-front of manager.\nCan someone come with his stats or idea about this?",

    "text": "How long will the likes of Revcontent, Outbrain, Taboola ea continue to get away with these avalanches of scam ads? If it was just idiotic bottom-of-the-barrel click bait in the ads you see posted through their widgets I wouldn't even consider it much of a problem, just as long as unsuspecting readers don't get scammed and only the publishers allowing the widgets on their sites pay for it.\n\nAnd that is precisely the problem.  Taboola, Outbrain, Revcontent and the likes of them willingly and knowingly let scammers post ads on unsuspecting websites with unsuspecting readers through their respective widgets or whatnot. They care nothing that people get scammed, as long as they get the kickback paid to them.\n\nHow do I know they do this willingly and knowingly? Simple. The sheer volume of obvious financial and/or medical scams posted through these widgets has not declined one bit throughout all of the the 2010s up to this very day in 2021. This means that you can easily establish that:\n\na) they know about these scam ads\n\nb) they continue hosting them anyway\n\nand\n\nc) don't have any sort of quality control in place\n\nbecause\n\nd) revenue (kickbacks) from scam ads is a key part of their business model\n\nNow I know some people will say that essentially one shouldn't blame them for all the scam ads, a few will always slip through the cracks, after all.\n\nHowever, that is not the case with the Taboolas, Outbrains and Revcontents of this world. The earlier mentioned sheer volume of these scam ads point to that the revenue therefrom (aka kickbacks) is a key component of their annual profits.\n\nThe majority of their ads are either scams or bottom-of-the-barrel clickbait. That proves that it is central to their business model and not a case of a few super smart scammers managing to slip their ads past quality control.\n\nThe counter argument that these companies often come up with can be compared to a bank robber claiming that he should not be convicted for participating in a robbery because he was just the guy who drove the getaway car and was never even in the building that got robbed.\n\nIn my opinion, they should be considered co-conspirators to the scams along with the publishers that allow the widgets on their site to begin with. I am also of the opinion that they are criminal enterprises.",

I swear to God that these ads are so bad it's like they are mocking themselves.\n\n\"Sick of the blue pill, here is an easy solution for ED that 92% of men don't know about!\"\n\nThere are so many of these laughable ads at the bottom of pages and I can't believe that anybody actually clicks on these. If you have even a little bit of critical thinking skills, you would realize that these are clearly clickbait articles. \n\nOk first of all if there was an easy solution for any kind of common issue such as ED, a lot more people that 8% would know about it. Things like that just don't remain secret. What is going through the heads of people who actually click on these (with the exception of those who click on them once just out of curiosity as to what will happen if they do)? I just think to myself: Don't accidentally click on one of these articles because you will get scammed. If you do click on one of these articles (which I did once out of morbid curiosity as to what would happen if I did), you get sent to websites that send you to other websites and the whole thing is extremely sketchy (surprise surprise!). Maybe the target audience is little kids who don't know any better yet?\n\nAlong similar lines, how do people fall for such blatantly obvious scams? Recently, I got a text saying that a parcel from a post office delivery company was not delivered and that I had to click on a link to get it re-delivered. There were punctuation errors in this text and the email address was a personal one (a first and last name), nothing that looked like the official company. I also hadn't actually ordered any parcels at this time and furthermore, the company they were impersonating doesn't send texts either (which you can literally just look up). \n\nI have trouble believing that there are people out there who are actually this stupid. What I've heard is that the strategy is to intentionally make these scams badly designed so that it weeds out anybody who is intelligent enough to eventually figure out it is a scam. Anybody who actually believes it initially is dumb enough to not realize later on that it is a scam. Often times if you are still somehow unsure, you can do a simple google search and figure out that something is a scam. Obviously these scams do work sometimes or else they wouldn't exist. \n\nDo some people literally have no critical thinking skills?",

    "text": "OK I'm saying it: Taboola and Outbrain are hurting your brand TL/DR: Publishers should realize that consumers are becoming wise to sponsored content and will stop trusting the validity of their sites if native ads are snuck onto pages at every opportunity.\n\nAdvertisers and marketers have been flocking to content discovery platforms like Taboola and Outbrain in an attempt to get their content seen by the masses. And why shouldn't they? An optimized native advertising strategy has a much better click-through rate when compared to banner ads.\n\nWell let's take a step back and just look at the type of content publishers are allowing on their sites....\n\nHeadlines like: Finally, an explanation for Hillary Clinton's long bathroom break OR 18 Chilling images of abandoned places that will give you... have nothing to do with posts genuine quality content. \n\nWhile I understand why publishers post sponsored content (money) what I don't understand is why they are willing to tarnish their brands image just to earn some extra cash. And what I fear the most is that these platforms are encouraging marketers to stop crafting quality, relevant pieces of content. I believe many marketers are becoming unwisely fixated on delivering higher click-through rates pieces and have become slaves to A/B testing attention grabbing headlines. Why is this a bad thing? Because marketers are spending time and money trying to, in essence, trick people onto their sites in lieu of focusing on creating quality content that speaks to their audience.  \n\nNow, I'm not saying that Taboola and Outbrain are bad services, they are easy to manage, have great customer service, and provide real value to many businesses (who are going about it in the proper way, see my recommendations at the end of the article). What I am saying is that advertisers and publishers should not risk devaluing their brand for the sake a low quality traffic and some extra money, respectively.\n\nAdvertisers should realize that consumers will eventually develop an immunity to sponsored posts if they keep driving consumers to crap content! Just look at what happened with banner ads... Fun fact, when banner ads originally came on the scene they were generating a click-through rate of about 44%! Now consumers only engage with ads 0.06% of the time. Why is this? Because for years banner ads were driving consumers to spammy sites! After awhile consumers just stopped clicking.\n\nI believe that there's a need for content discovery networks, BUT they need to drive consumers to quality relevant content!\n\nI wrote a more detailed post with links, photos and recommendations - check it out here [taboola and outbrain](http://content.support/blog/are-taboola-and-outbrain-hurting-your-brand)",

Extend repairs 1-2 feet beyond visible damage, or 10-20% of the beam span, whichever is greater, to ensure sound wood. Replace the entire beam if damage is extensive, compromises structural integrity, or is nearly as costly to repair as replace. Consult a structural engineer for critical situations or extensive damage, and always follow building codes. Safety is paramount; use proper support during repairs.",

The sarcastic question about how much Dr. Gundry is paying suggests skepticism about Taboola’s business practices and an overemphasis on one advertiser’s campaigns. No direct mention is made of financial performance, and publisher relations are only weakly implied via ad placements. Overall tone is clearly negative and sarcastic, without any positive counterbalance.",

    "text": "Taboola Officer Plans $1.4M Stock Sale Under 10b5-1 Plan \n\n\n---\n\n## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n#### SEC Filing Analysis: Taboola.com Ltd. (TBLA)\n\n#### Executive Summary\n\n- **Trading Significance**: Medium\n- **Key Takeaway**: An officer of Taboola.com Ltd. has filed a notice of a proposed sale of shares valued at approximately $1.41 million, executed under a pre-arranged 10b5-1 trading plan.\n- **Market Impact**: The transaction is of moderate size relative to the company's market capitalization and is unlikely to cause significant market disruption, especially given it is a planned sale.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | Taboola.com Ltd. |\n| Ticker Symbol | TBLA (Not in filing, added for context) |\n| CIK | 0001840502 |\n| Industry | SERVICES-COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, DATA PROCESSING, ETC. |\n\n#### Insider Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Name | Maniv Eldad |\n| CIK | 0001952049 |\n| Title/Position | Not Specified |\n| Relationship | Officer |\n\n#### Transaction Details\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Form Type | 144 (Notice of Proposed Sale) |\n| Transaction Date | 2025-11-05 (Approximate) |\n| Transaction Code | Not Applicable |\n| Security Type | Ordinary Shares |\n| Shares Involved | 424,861 |\n| Price Per Share | ~$3.33 (Calculated) |\n| Total Value | $1,414,787.13 |\n| Shares Owned After | Not Stated |\n| Ownership Type | Not Stated |\n\n#### Financial Impact Assessment\n\n#### Transaction Materiality\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Transaction Value | $1,414,787.13 |\n| % of Market Cap | 0.14% |\n| Shares Transacted | 424,861 |\n| % of Shares Outstanding | 0.16% |\n| Post-Transaction Ownership | Not stated in filing |\n| Materiality Assessment | Moderate |\n\n#### Impact Evaluation\n\n- **Market Cap Context**: For a company with a market capitalization of $0.99 billion, this $1.41 million transaction is not considered large-scale. It represents a small fraction of the company's total value.\n- **Ownership Concentration**: Without post-transaction ownership data, it is not possible to assess the impact on the insider's ownership concentration.\n- **Transaction Significance**: The sale constitutes 0.14% of the market cap and 0.16% of shares outstanding. These percentages fall into the 'Moderate' significance category, indicating a transaction that warrants attention but is not substantial enough to be considered a major market-moving event on its own.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Neutral\n- **Reasoning**: This is a Form 144 filing, which is a notice of a *proposed* sale, not a completed one. Furthermore, the sale is being conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 plan adopted on March 17, 2025. Such plans are established in advance, which typically means the sale is for personal financial planning, diversification, or tax purposes, rather than a reaction to recent company performance. Therefore, it is generally viewed as a neutral signal by the market.\n\n#### Volume &amp; Sentiment\n\n- **Expected Volume Impact**: A potential increase in trading volume around the approximate sale date as the 424,861 shares enter the market, but the impact should be limited given the stock's typical liquidity.\n- **Sentiment Indicator**: Neutral. Pre-planned insider sales are common and do not usually carry the negative sentiment associated with spontaneous, large-block sales.\n\n#### Investment Insights\n\n#### Positive Market Indicators\n\n- The use of a 10b5-1 plan suggests an orderly and transparent process, reducing the likelihood of the sale being based on negative inside information.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- While a single planned sale is neutral, a pattern of multiple insiders selling over time could be a cumulative negative signal.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Planned Sale**: This is a proposed sale by an officer, not a spontaneous market action, which significantly lessens its informational value.\n2. **Moderate Materiality**: The transaction size is moderate, representing a very small percentage of the company's market cap and outstanding shares.\n3. **Neutral Signal**: Due to the pre-arranged nature of the 10b5-1 plan, this filing should be viewed as a neutral event concerning the company's near-term prospects.\n\n#### Additional Context\n\n#### Special Circumstances\n\n- The filing explicitly states the proposed sale is pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted nearly eight months prior to the filing date. This is a critical piece of context that frames the transaction as part of a long-term strategy.\n\n---\n\n#### Important Disclaimer\n\n**This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.**\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available SEC filings and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities.

The company also disclosed an aggressive share buyback, having repurchased 14% of the company in 2025.\n- **Market Impact**: The filing is highly positive, indicating strong operational performance and management confidence, which is often viewed bullishly by the market.\n\n#### Company Information\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Company | Taboola.com Ltd. |\n| Ticker Symbol | TBLA |\n| CIK | 0001840502 |\n| Industry | Services-Computer Programming, Data Processing, Etc. |\n\n#### Filing Details\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Form Type | 8-K |\n| Event Date | 2025-11-05 |\n| Description | Report of Financial Results and Corporate Guidance |\n\n#### Financial Results Summary (Q3 2025 vs Q3 2024)\n\n| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q3 2024 | Change |\n|--------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Revenues | $496.8M | $433.0M | +14.7% |\n| Gross Profit | $139.0M | $132.9M | +4.6% |\n| Net Income | $5.2M | $(6.5)M | Positive Swing |\n| Adjusted EBITDA | $48.2M | $47.9M | +0.6% |\n\n#### Updated Guidance\n\n- **Q4 2025 Revenue:** $532M - $542M\n- **FY 2025 Revenue:** Raised to $1,914M - $1,932M\n\n#### Financial Impact Assessment\n\n#### Key Event Materiality\n\nThe most significant disclosure is the aggressive share buyback program.\n- **CEO Statement:** \"...aggressively buy back shares, having already repurchased 14% of the company this year.\"\n- **Context:** For a company with a market cap of $1.04 billion, a 14% buyback represents a capital return of approximately **$145.6 million**, a highly material event.\n- **Balance Sheet Confirmation:** The consolidated balance sheet shows Treasury Shares at cost increased from $130.1M at the end of 2024 to $314.9M as of September 30, 2025, confirming significant repurchase activity.\n\n#### Impact Evaluation\n\n- **Market Cap Context**: Taboola's strong revenue growth and return to profitability are significant for a company in the ~$1 billion market cap range, where such performance can have a substantial impact on valuation.\n- **Capital Allocation**: The decision to repurchase 14% of the company is a powerful signal of management's belief that the stock is undervalued. This action directly increases earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\n- **Performance Momentum**: Beating revenue and profit guidance, coupled with raising the full-year outlook, indicates that the company's growth is accelerating, driven by its 'Realize' performance platform.\n\n#### Market Impact Analysis\n\n#### Stock Impact Prediction\n\n- **Direction**: Positive\n- **Reasoning**: The combination of beating earnings estimates, raising future guidance, and executing a massive share buyback program are three distinct and strong bullish catalysts. This news is likely to be received very favorably by investors.\n\n#### Volume &amp; Sentiment\n\n- **Expected Volume Impact**: High. Earnings reports, especially those containing surprises and guidance changes, typically lead to significantly increased trading volume.\n- **Sentiment Indicator**: Bullish. The report contains multiple points of positive news with no apparent negative offsets, signaling strong business health and management confidence.\n\n#### Investment Insights\n\n#### Positive Market Indicators\n\n- **Earnings Beat**: Surpassing the high-end of guidance demonstrates strong execution.\n- **Raised Outlook**: Indicates management's confidence in sustained momentum into Q4 and the full year.\n- **Aggressive Share Buyback**: A 14% repurchase is a highly material capital return and signals a belief that the stock is undervalued. This is a significant driver of shareholder value.\n- **Return to Profitability**: Moving from a net loss to a net income YoY is a critical milestone.\n\n#### Risk Factors\n\n- While the report is positive, investors will watch to see if the growth from the 'Realize' platform is sustainable and if margins can continue to improve despite higher hosting and marketing costs mentioned in the report.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Strong Execution**: Taboola is outperforming its own expectations, a sign of a healthy and well-managed business.\n2. **Major Capital Return**: The 14% share buyback is a significant and direct return of value to shareholders, reducing share count and boosting EPS.\n3. **Bullish Outlook**: Management is not only performing well now but is publicly signaling confidence that this strong performance will continue.\n\n#### Additional Context\n\n#### Transaction Notes\n\n- **Event**: This 8-K filing reports the company's quarterly financial results.\n- **Key Exhibit**: The full details are contained in the press release, filed as Exhibit 99.1.\n\n---\n\n#### Important Disclaimer\n\n**This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only and is NOT investment advice.**\n\nThe information presented is based on publicly available SEC filings and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities.

However, margin pressure from rising traffic acquisition costs (notably from Yahoo-related contracts), declining cash reserves, and higher capital expenditures warrant close monitoring. Active share repurchases support shareholder value, but significant outstanding equity awards imply potential future dilution. The company's financial position remains stable, with improving adjusted profitability metrics and sufficient liquidity, but ongoing TAC and FX risks should be watched by investors.\n\nVisit [Publicview AI](https://www.publicview.ai/chat) to search and analyze millions of SEC filings using AI.",

However, inventory wise most DSPs access whatever inventory you’ll want these days. All DSPs now are preaching “transparency” so I’d really prioritize:\n\n1) ease of use (do you have ads or need them made? A creative studio would be nice to have on a DSP then)\n2) do you have an ad server you’ll use as a source of truth or DSP numbers will be used?\n3) you’re a brand, can you easily onboard 1P data without support from the DSP \n4) do you have access to a dedicated support rep and are there SLAs in place for them to respond to you\n5) contextual capabilities \n6) reporting - if you’re doing things outside of programmatic for your brand, can you use the DSP’s API to pull all of your data across channels into a report\n7) inventory quality/brand safety - IMO both of these DSPs are meh in this area. Taboola specifically has been bottom feeder trash inventory for a long time. \n\nThere’s more to consider but you get the gist.",

    "text": "I've worked with small brands and my first question to them (if they are not digital native) is always: what are you hoping to get from programmatic that you can't get from search/social?\n\n\nProgrammatic is either for high budgets or small budgets+high skills. High budgets still require skills, but they allow you to fail and test&amp;learn, which you can't do with small budgets.\n\n\nIf your goal is to try programmatic because you want to learn along the way without having specific targets to hits, then that's a fair objective (i.e. gaining in knowledge and up skilling).\n\n\nMy humble advice if you're too small and with limited or no programmatic knowledge: 1/get an ad server 2/directly deal with the publishers that reach your audiences. Yes, it might be a bit more expensive (in money and time), but you diminish the risk of fraud and buying crappy traffic (which end up more expensive).\n\n\nI'm sharing this knowing that I'm pro programmatic, pro in-house, pro dsp. I certainly don't recommend working with small DSPs. They've got to pay the bills and the investors (or the other way around if unlucky), and they don't care about the traffic they buy, which can permanently damage your brand.",

A display ad will show your logo, and the product (if you are selling something) and maybe have your catchphrase. Which is fine when all you need to do to generate sales is say something like “just do it” or coke is it.”\n\nBut when your offering needs people to understand why it’s valuable to them, native gives you the room to explain that. Native forces you to include copy with your image, and most native doesn’t want your logo. So the copy has to convince the customer to click and learn more..and thats the other part of native that people miss. It used to be content discovery, and thats still where its value is. Pay off what the copy says in the page it clicks through to. Continue to build up the why before you ask the consumer for a form fill or a purchase. \n\nDm me if you wanna chat. I used to work at outbrain. Taboola and out brain are the coke and pepsi of native",

I decided I'd loudly say something expensive that I'd never talk about in real life around my phone at least 15-20 times a day, and see if it affected my ads. I settled on \"orthodontics.\"\n\nSo whenever I was home alone, I'd just start loudly talking like a maniac about orthodontics. \"Man, I could really use some orthodontics right now!\" \"Gotta get some orthodontics for my kids' weird-ass teeth!\" and so on. Like you'd expect nothing happened, but literally the day after I told my friends about it in a whatsapp chat, I started getting ads for orthodontics in Tinder.  I suppose there are a lot of privacy leaks there where it could have originated, but the speed that it happened made me suspect that it was data moving within the facebook ecosystem (Tinder requires, or did at the time, a facebook login).",

Because WhatsApp’s content is encrypted, artificial intelligence systems can’t automatically scan all chats, images and videos, as they do on Facebook and Instagram. Instead, WhatsApp reviewers gain access to private content when users hit the “report” button on the app, identifying a message as allegedly violating the platform’s terms of service. This forwards five messages — the allegedly offending one along with the four previous ones in the exchange, including any images or videos — to WhatsApp in unscrambled form, according to former WhatsApp engineers and moderators. Automated systems then feed these tickets into “reactive” queues for contract workers to assess.\n\nIt would be exactly like if I sent you a PGP email and then you forwarded it to the cops. Or Facebook. Or your TikTok followers. “Encrypted” does not mean “unforwardable.”",

    "text": "I am one of the founders of [https://reciprocalad.com](https://reciprocalad.com) . It is a completely different strategy for advertisement that I haven't found anywhere on the web. It is displaying ads of other sites/brands in exchange for ads of your own to drive traffic to our sites. A reciprocal ad network. Let's say you are a beginner and get 1000 unique visitors for your niche blog netting you $3 in Google Adsense revenue. The question I have for you is would you rather have the $3 or \\~1000 ads for your blog displayed on other sites throughout the web? The thesis with [reciprocalad.com](http://reciprocalad.com/) is that 1000 ads of your own especially for blogs and sites that are focused on growth is more valuable than the $3. Members act as both the advertisers and publishers. This is a completely **cashless system.** It is ad 4 ad instead of ad 4 cash or cash 4 ad. You upload your own ads and insert a JavaScript snippet into your page and everything else so far is automated. Right now the ad placements are automated (good chance this may change before the beta) and driven on keywords/category. I am trying to recruit 20 sites/brands to get started and I am still a little under halfway there.",

However, I wanted to wait until I was back at my PC to give you a comprehensive answer. \n\nYour store / product portfolio fits perfectly with Native Ads. \n\nWhy? \n\nReason 1: You are addressing a target group that generates the best performance with native ads. Older people, who should probably buy your products and have the problem you are trying to solve, usually react much better to native ads and move more in the editorial public environment than young people. \n\nReason 2: Your brand looks very serious at first glance, also due to the “Switzerland branding”. This in turn also contributes to reason 1. \n\nReason 3: Average selling price. Here we are in a good range for these products (if bundle options are purchased). With a sales price in the 60-90 USD range, it should normally be possible to achieve the target CPA (no guarantee). \n\nReason 4: Your store sells products that may generate repeat customers. This means that even a break-even ROA from prospecting campaigns could be enough to be successful with native campaigns in the long term thanks to the CLV. \n\nIf these reasons are enough for you to test native, feel free to write me a DM :) no strings attached!",

I started more or less directly with Native Ads (Taboola). Started with a classic €200 daily budget. It took me 3 days to be crazy profitable with 300% ROAS on average. Then I quickly went up to 1,000€/day and even then I was still really profitable with 150-170% ROAS. But then I quickly went up again to €2,000/day and from then on it was broken. Negative days with only 60% ROAS etc.\n\nNow I'm back down to €1,000/day, but it's fluctuating wildly between 80-120% ROAS, so there's hardly anything left in real terms.\n\nHas anyone at Taboola experienced this and can share their experiences?\nOur Taboola rep says it's due to fast scaling but all his tips so far have been really bad.\n\nAnyone doing well on Taboola and willing to share how they figured it out?\n\nThx",

Hello everyone,\n\nSo I created a new campaign and used MonetiseMore's traffic cop free trial to analyze the traffic. \n\nI wanted to check if I will get some suspicious traffic from the network. And unfortunately, I did. \n\nHere is a screenshot from Traffic Cop of yesterday:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3djrut5jo5t91.png?width=1038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7e8dbe07d76fe46de886888874fd562a7c4e630\n\n More than half of the traffic is invalid, here is the breakdown from Traffic Cop:  \n\n\n* 30% medium-risk IP addresses\n* 63% invalid browser setup\n* 6% abnormal browsing behavior\n\n I know this is not much traffic to analyze, but I received this traffic from big websites like MSN and 9GAG. other small websites will definitely have much worse traffic.  \n \\-----------\n\n When I was browsing a website full of AdSense ads, one of the ads suddenly stopped working (it went black), when I clicked on it, it took me to an IAS landing page saying that the advertiser was not happy with who I am (I was browsing the site on data canter IP and spoofed OS).\n\nIs it possible to do the same with Taboola? I mean not serving my ads if the visitor is suspicious (unusual user agent, data center IP...)\n\nThank you.",

You just have to stay on top of things by actively detecting click fraud and blocking the websites responsible for the fake clicks. \n\nTo give an example, we had a customer who was getting around 50,000 fake clicks each month, and we got it down to a few hundred, just by blocking the scam websites responsible for the clicks.\n\nAn alternative strategy you can use is to not use Taboola. :) If you stick to Google Search and Bing Search (no search partners and no display websites), your exposure to click fraud will be small, typically less than 1% of your clicks.",
