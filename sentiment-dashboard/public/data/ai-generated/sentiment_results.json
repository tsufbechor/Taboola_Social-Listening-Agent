We just finished a 6-week test:\n- Same budgets as Meta + Google search\n- Realize using Predictive Audiences + their new Motion Ads\n- Optimization goal: purchases (ecom, AOV ~$70)\n\nTop-line:\n- CPA on Realize came in ~18% cheaper than our existing Taboola native campaigns\n- Conversion rate on Motion Ads was legitimately ~15–20% higher than the static images we started with\n- They actually hit our ROAS target after week 3 once the algorithm had enough pixel data\n\nBUT:\n- Reporting feels very black-box. I can’t see enough breakdown by publisher/placement to feel comfortable scaling x5.\n- Click quality is mixed — some sessions look super engaged, others are 5s bounces that scream \"chumbox but with AI\".\n- Their UI is nicer than the old Taboola Ads, but still miles behind Google Ads in terms of workflows.\n\nCurious if other ad ops / performance folks are:\n1) Actually scaling Realize budgets beyond \"test\" level\n2) Seeing sustainable performance or just honeymoon phase while the algo learns\n3) Worried about brand safety / click arbitrage on the open web",

    "text": "Publisher POV on Taboola Realize – anyone else conflicted? We turned on Realize across display + native units a couple months ago. Not just the usual bottom-of-article widgets – they’re now filling more prominent slots programmatically.\n\nPros:\n- RPM is up ~22% vs our previous setup with standard native + display.\n- Their team keeps talking about tapping into \"performance budgets\" that normally go straight to search/social, and honestly the money is showing up.\n- Fill is strong, even on some smaller sections of the site that were hard to monetize.\n\nCons:\n- The creatives still feel like Taboola. Some are fine, some are classic \"You won’t believe what happened next\" energy.\n- UX team is furious. They say it cheapens the brand and we’re going backwards into chumbox land just as everyone else is cleaning it up.\n- We don’t have great controls to distinguish Realize performance ads vs the old-school content recs when something looks dodgy.\n\nAnyone else on the publisher side rolling this out? Are your business/finance folks just saying \"RPM good, stop complaining\" or has anyone actually pushed for stricter policies around what Realize can serve?",

Our MMM spreadsheet says it is more of a strong supporting player than a miracle worker.\n\nThe good:\n- Scale beyond search/social is real. We got incremental reach on audiences that never click our Meta ads.\n- Creative tools are actually nice – being able to auto-generate variations from one hero concept saved our tiny team tons of time.\n\nThe meh:\n- Attribution feels generous. If someone sees us on Realize, searches brand on Google the next day, Realize still tries to claim the win.\n- UI still has odd quirks (filters randomly resetting, basic bulk-edit pain).\n\nNet: we’re keeping it in the mix at 15–20% of spend, but not turning off Meta for this any time soon.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who did go all-in and moved a big chunk of performance budget to Realize – was it worth it long-term?",

    "text": "B2B folks – any luck with Taboola Realize for SaaS? Most of the Realize case studies I’m seeing are ecom, financial publishers, or big performance advertisers.\n\nWe’re B2B SaaS (mid-ticket, around $10k ACV, long sales cycle):\n- Uploaded our won-opps to build Predictive Audiences\n- Optimized to demo requests\n- Ran a mix of thought-leadership content and more direct-response creatives\n\nResults after 45 days:\n- CPL is actually competitive with LinkedIn, but lead quality is all over the place.\n- SDR team says half the Realize leads \"just wanted to read the article\" and have zero intent.\n- On the plus side, we’re seeing more top-of-funnel awareness in regions where we had literally no paid presence before.\n\nFeels like Realize is somewhere between top-funnel display and real performance for us.\n\nAnyone cracked a playbook here? Better to treat it as:\n- Cheap reach and retargeting fuel, or\n- A legit performance channel once you tighten audiences and creative enough?",
